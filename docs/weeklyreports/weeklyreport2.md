# Weekly report, week 2

This week I wrote the LZ78 compression and decompression algorithms and tests for them. 
I also set up cmake, github actions and codecov.
I haven't used c++ or cmake too much, so I got more familiar and comfortable with them.
Next week I will start writing the Huffman coding algorithms. 
I might add another compression algorithm to the project, **IF** I can implement them quickly.
