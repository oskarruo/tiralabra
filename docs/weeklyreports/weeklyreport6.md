# Weekly report, week 6

This week I put some final touches to the project. 
I changed the writer and reader buffer sizes to be a bit more efficient, and I updated and clarified the documentation.
Since I had nothing else to do in the limited time I had, I wrote an automated python script for running the efficiency tests. 

In my opinion, the project is ready. 
The only thing I'm not certain about is the level of testing, but based on previous example projects it seems that it's enough. 
Please let me know if this is not the case.
