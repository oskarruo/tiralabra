# Project specification

- **Project language**: C++
- **Other languages that can be reviewed**: Python, JS/TS (or really anything common)
- **Algorithms that will be written**: LZ78 & Huffman coding compression/decompression
- **Problem that will be solved**: How to compress text without losing data, which algorithm is faster, which algorithm achieves better compression
- **Inputs of the program**: The program will get a .txt file as an input and will output a new .txt file
- **Usage of the program**: The program will be used from the command-line where the input file and compress/decompress option is specified
- **Target time complexity**: According to sources, O(n) can be achieved for LZ compression/decompression, O(n log n) for Huffman coding compression, and O(n) for Huffman coding decompression
- **Sources**: The primary sources for implementing the program will be:
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding
- **Core**: The core of the project is compression algorithms
- **Curriculum**: TKT
- **Documentation language**: English
